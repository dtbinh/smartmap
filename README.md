## SmartMap

*An Android application about finding your friends*

#### Description

SmartMap is a relatively big project (biggest I have worked on so far) that was coded as part of the EPFL course [Software Engineering](http://sweng.epfl.ch/) with a team of 8 computer science students.

The application uses a Facebook login and from there you can send invitations to your friends. Once accepted, both users can see each other on the map in real time. The application contains many features, the most important being
* Creation of custom public Events anywhere on the map, with a description and a time interval.
* Sending of Friend/Event invitations
* Notifications inside and outside the context of the application
* Offline mode
* Custom notifications selection
* Refresh frequency
* Custom profile and facebook picture
* Search through nearby events
* Possibility to create groups of friends and display them all at once
* Quick Search through Friends, Events and Filters
* Pin coloration based on friend's last connection time
